# Permissions

Currently there are no endpoints in place to modify permissions for a resource.
There are plans to add those endpoints in the future. What follows is a list of
default permissions for each resource type.

## Images
Images are publically viewable, and editable or deletable by the owner only.

## Users
Users are publically viewable, and editable or deletable by the user only.

More fine grained permissions would include making an image public or private,
or sharing it among a specific group of people.
