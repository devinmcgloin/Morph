# Todo

## API

- Flush out routes schema
- Make SQL queries more modular and expressive
  - Perhaps feed in a query object with fields and focus on generating that?

## Views

- Define Common views and send queries over to the SQL builder.
- Need to define both backend and front end view content.

## Authentication

- Work with integrating OAuth as the primary login system.
  - Dont bother with email fallback till OAuth is done.

## Handlers

- Define layouts for the front and backend.
